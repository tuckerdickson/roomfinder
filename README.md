# Room Finder

Use the Indoor Mapping Data Format (IMDF) to show an indoor map with custom overlays and points of interest for the Seaman's Center at the University of Iowa.

## Overview

Currently, there are ample resources to navigate to get to buildings, but not within the buildings. Wayfinding within those buildings can be overwhelming and create a large barrier for a student’s success. To mitigate this stress, we are creating an iOS app that serves as a tool to help navigate the Seaman’s Center. The code for this project is housed within this GitHub page. 

- Note: The sample code for this project is associated with WWDC 2019 session [241: Adding Indoor Maps to your App and Website](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc19/241).
